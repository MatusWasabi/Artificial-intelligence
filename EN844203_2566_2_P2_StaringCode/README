Our program use minimax function with alphabeta pruning with depth of 5 (Constant number).


Hueristic used: Fabbonacci number
Step 1. Check for vertically, horizontally, diagonally. When it checks, it will keep what it is checking as Window. (def score_position)
Step 2. Then the window is used in Evaluate window to check the element inside it. (def evaluate_window)
Step 3. The score is depended on Fabbonacci sequence of count of piece we are checking
Step 4. The score will be deducted on Fabbanacci sequence of count of piece againt us.


So Basically, the call stack of the minimax function will be.
Minimax(n) -> Minimax(n - 1) -> ... -> Minimax(0) -> score_position -> evaluate window.
